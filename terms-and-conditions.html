YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE RELEASING US FROM ANY LIABILITY THAT WE MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO YOU IN RELATION TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES, FOR REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FAILURE OF OUR SERVICE, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER TORT. TO THE EXTENT THAT PLATFORMLICABLE LAW RESTRICTS THIS RELEASE OF LIABILITY, YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE ONLY LIABLE TO YOU FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT THE LAW RESTRICTS OUR LIABILITY TO, IF SUCH A MINIMUM EXISTS.

		YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY USE OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PEOPLE WHO COMMIT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, DEFAMATION, TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH ECONOMIC RELATIONS, OR ANY OTHER ACTIONABLE CONDUCT TOWARDS YOU.

		For Jurisdictions that Do Not Allow Us to Limit Our Liability

		Notwithstanding any provision of these Terms, if your jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the above then our liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law. Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.

		IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING PLATFORMLIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE PLATFORMLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE NEW YORK CIVIL CODE.

		Where the subject matter of a dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to, this Agreement, the Service or your use of the Service, or any products or services offered or distributed through the Service (“Disputes”) is eligible for it, you agree that any disputes shall be heard solely within the New York Small Claims Court (“Small Claims Court”). If a dispute claims multiple claims and one or more of those claims would be eligible to be heard by the Small Claims Court, you agree not to bring the other claims against us and to instead proceed within the Small Claims Court. If you would be entitled in a dispute to an amount exceeding the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, you agree to waive your right to collect any damages in excess of the monetary jurisdiction and instead still bring your claim within the Small Claims Court.  At the time of drafting this Agreement, the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court is $5,000. You agree that if a dispute is eligible to be heard in Small Claims Court but you would be entitled to an additional or alternative remedy in a higher court, such as injunctive relief, you will waive your right to that remedy and still bring the dispute within the Small Claims Court.

		Except as specifically stated herein, all other Disputes not eligible for resolution in Small Claims Court shall be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration. You hereby waive your right to have any future Dispute heard by a judge or jury (except as otherwise set forth in this Section 26). The provisions of this Section 26 shall constitute your and ArDrive’s written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any modification to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by you and ArDrive. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to its rules.

		You agree that you may bring claims against us only in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. In addition, you agree that disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.

		Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, either party may bring suit in court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California, seeking an injunction or other equitable relief arising out of or relating to the infringement of a party’s or a third party’s intellectual property rights.

		You agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action shall be permanently barred.

		If you bring a dispute in a manner other than in accordance with this section, you agree that we may move to have it dismissed, and that you will be responsible for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements in doing so.

		You agree that any Dispute that, for whatever reason, is deemed not subject to the jurisdiction requirements set forth above shall be subject to exclusive jurisdiction in the state or federal courts in Los Angeles, California.

	<p class="text-gray">
		Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in your web browser’s cache or app’s local memory. We take no responsibility for stored information in your cache, or in other devices that may store information, and disclaim all liability of such. In addition, we may, from time to time, retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.

	</p>

	<h5><a href="ardrive.io/start" target="_blank"> <span style="background-color: #fafafa; color: #121212;">38. Cookies, Web Beacons, Browser Local Storage & Similar Technologies</span></a></h5>


	<p class="text-gray">
		Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or other devices by websites that you visit.

		We may use cookies for various purposes including, but not limited to, remembering your preferences, maintaining user sessions, improving security of our services, collecting usage information, and targeting ads.

		Since cookies are used to maintain user sessions, it is necessary that you enable cookies in your browser to be able to log into the Service, and you hereby acknowledge that we have informed you of our use of cookies and that you consent to our use of cookies in relation to the platform by which you are accessing our Service.

		We may use the Web Storage API (a.k.a, local or session storage) provided by your browser or app to cache information related to your account, including your personal data.

		We may use various third-party services that may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect information. Such services include, but not limited to, web analytics services, advertisement services, and social media services.

		This Agreement does not cover cookies practices used by third-party service providers. We will do our best to maintain links to privacy policies of the third-party service providers that we use in this document.

	</p>

	<h5><a href="ardrive.io/start" target="_blank"> <span style="background-color: #fafafa; color: #121212;">39. Third-Party Websites</span></a></h5>


	<p class="text-gray">
		We may post links to third-party websites on our Service. Additionally, other materials made available through our Service may contain third-party website links or files. We do not screen third-party websites or files for privacy or security issues, and you release us from any liability for the conduct or content of these third parties.

		Please be aware that this Agreement, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service. We bear no responsibility for the information collected or used by any advertiser or third-party website. Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit.

	</p>

	<h5><a href="ardrive.io/start" target="_blank"> <span style="background-color: #fafafa; color: #121212;">40. Third-Party Access to Your Information</span></a></h5>


	<p class="text-gray">
		Although you are entering into an agreement with us to disclose your information to us, we do use third-party individuals and organizations to assist us, including contractors, advertising partners, web hosting companies, and others.

		Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information. For example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our Service.

		It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Agreement. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Agreement, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our Service or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.

		Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you authorize us to collect, share, store, exchange, and otherwise use your information in conjunction with the Service.

	<h5><a href="ardrive.io/start" target="_blank"> <span style="background-color: #fafafa; color: #121212;">41. Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</span></a></h5>


	<p class="text-gray">
		At times, it may become necessary or desirable, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.

	<h5><a href="ardrive.io/start" target="_blank"> <span style="background-color: #fafafa; color: #121212;">42. Security Measures</span></a></h5>


	<p class="text-gray">
		We take certain measures to enhance the security of our Service, specifically: (i) the Service is protected by multiple firewalls for secure access; (ii) the Service is protected by SSL certificates that encrypts all ingress and egress traffic; (iii) Network Security Groups (NSG) allow only the intended traffic to traverse between the servers hosting the application; and (iv) periodic vulnerability assessment and penetration testing is carried out on the Service.

	</p>

	<h5><a href="ardrive.io/start" target="_blank"> <span style="background-color: #fafafa; color: #121212;">43. Your Legal Rights</span></a></h5>


	<p class="text-gray">
		You have the right to:

		Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. This would be a pointless request for you because we do not collect any personal data from you.

		Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. This would be a pointless request for you because we do not collect any personal data from you.

		Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. This would be a pointless request for you because we do not collect any personal data from you.

		Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. This would be a pointless request for you because we do not collect any personal data from you.

		Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (i) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (ii) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. This would be a pointless request for you because we do not collect any personal data from you.

		Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. This would be a pointless request for you because we do not collect any personal data from you.

		Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide our Service to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

		No fee usually required so that you will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

		Time limit to respond to your legitimate requests will be one (1) month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

		If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact our DPM (see above).

	<h5><a href="ardrive.io/start" target="_blank"> <span style="background-color: #fafafa; color: #121212;">44. Your California Online Privacy Rights</span></a></h5>


	<p class="text-gray">
		We permit residents of California to use our Service. Therefore, it is our intent to comply with the California Business and Professions Code §§ 22575-22579. If you are a California resident you may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Various provisions throughout this Agreement address requirements of the Californian privacy statutes. In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors. You may contact us at legal@ArDrive.io with any questions.

	</p>

	<h5><a href="ardrive.io/start" target="_blank"> <span style="background-color: #fafafa; color: #121212;">45. International Transfer</span></a></h5>


	<p class="text-gray">
		We share your personal data within the company group. If you are located in the European Union, this will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) because we are a US-based company. We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. These rules are called "binding corporate rules". Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

		Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

		We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
		Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
		Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
		Please contact our DPM (see Section 34) if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.

	</p>

	<h5><a href="ardrive.io/start" target="_blank"> <span style="background-color: #fafafa; color: #121212;">46. Amendments</span></a></h5>


	<p class="text-gray">
		We may amend this Agreement from time to time. When we amend this Agreement, we will post the changes here. Your continued use of our Service shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. Historic versions can be obtained by contacting our DPM (see Section 35).
